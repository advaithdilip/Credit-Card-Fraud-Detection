# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Description
This project implements a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. It explores logistic regression as a classification technique and discusses the impact of class imbalance. The dataset used is `creditcard.csv`, which contains anonymized transaction details.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Data visualization and feature understanding.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Classification without oversampling.
- **Imbalance Handling**: Discussion on class imbalance and its impact.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluating model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model and evaluation.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/card-detect.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
